# Movie-list

This program allows users to enter movies into a list, read that list, then manipulate the list as requested. Users can store the movie they want to watch in order to keep organized. This is a simple, no frills way to store this infomation. In the future I hope to allow users to store multiple lists based on genre, re-order their lists, and rank list items in order of preference.

Users should follow the prompt to do their desired action, then quit once finished with their list.

Thanks to Abby Rii for collaborating with me.
